# Vanilla JS Raycasting Challenge

Welcome to the Vanilla JS Raycasting Challenge! ðŸš€

Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of 3D graphics and immersive gameplay? Then look no further! In this challenge, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity by building a Raycasting engine using nothing but Vanilla JavaScript.

### What is Raycasting?

Raycasting is a technique used in computer graphics to simulate 3D environments in a 2D space. By casting rays from a virtual camera's viewpoint, we can determine what objects are visible and render a realistic 3D scene in real-time.

### Why Vanilla JS?

Using Vanilla JavaScript allows you to demonstrate your understanding of core programming concepts and harness the full power of the language without relying on external libraries or frameworks. It's a great opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity in a pure and unadulterated form!

### Features of the Challenge:

- Implement a Raycasting engine using Vanilla JavaScript.
- Create a realistic 3D environment with walls, textures, and interactive elements.
- Ensure compatibility with PC controls only: Use arrow keys for movement and the spacebar to display the map.
- Can you make it work on mobile?

### How to Get Started:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to move around the environment and the spacebar to display the map.
4. Start coding your Raycasting engine in the `script.js` file and let your creativity shine!
